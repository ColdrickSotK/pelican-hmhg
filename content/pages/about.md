Summary:
    <p>Holcombe Moor Heritage Group is a group of volunteers with an interest
    in discovering the history of the Holcombe Moor area. Much of this area is
    owned by the Ministry of Defence, who are keen to learn more about their
    land and preserve its historical sites. We are also looking into the
    history of the area known in the past as the “Forest of Holcombe” which
    includes parts of Hawkshaw, Holcombe Brook and Greenmount.</p>
    <p>As a group we investigate the history of the area using a variety of
    methods, including archaeological excavations and searching through
    documentation, such as census returns, wills and maps. We also organise a
    series of speakers to talk on a variety of subjects with an historical
    theme during the winter months. There are also other events organised
    during the year.</p>
    <p>We would love to hear from you if you would like to get involved.</p>

Holcombe Moor Heritage Group is a group of volunteers with an interest in
discovering the history of the Holcombe Moor area. Much of this area is
owned by the Ministry of Defence, who are keen to learn more about their
land and preserve its historical sites. The MoD has in the past funded
several surveys, digs and other events on their site in conjunction with
University Archaeological Departments and the HMHG volunteers.

Unfortunately, this funding has now come to an end, meaning that HMHG is
on its own - having to raise its own funds and provide its own volunteers
for any future research (although with the full backing of the MoD to still
be active on their site). But with this new found freedom has come the
opportunity to extend our area of interest to the "Forest of Holcombe"
which takes in parts of Hawkshaw, Holcombe Brook and Greenmount.

We have an Annual General Meeting that is open to all members and where all
officers are elected under the terms of our constitution. As a group we
welcome any ideas from members and are particularly keen to hear from you
if you think we can change things to make us serve the group better or
appeal to a wider audience.

We hope you would like to join HMHG and get involved not only in your
specific area of interest (perhaps local history) but also in other areas
in which we are active. Please visit our contact page here to do so.
