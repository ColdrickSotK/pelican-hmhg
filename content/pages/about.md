Summary:
    <p>Holcombe Moor Heritage Group is an archaelogical group, based around
    the Holcombe Valley. Currently we are running an excavation at
    Bottoms Mill. We are a voluntary organisation, so volunteers are always
    welcome! We also have an ongoing project that is about discovering the
    lost farms that dot the landscape of the Holcombe Valley.</p>
    <p>We hope you would like to join HMHG and get involved not only in your
    specific area of interest (perhaps local history) but also in other
    areas in which we are active.</p>
    <p>The price we all have to pay is a £10 fee for a year's membership (£15
    for a whole household, or £5 for kids) - this helps pay towards our
    insurance to have activities on the MoD land - such as digs (organised
    by the Archaeology sub committee) and walks. It also pays towards other
    activities such as the desk based research into the wills and surrenders
    of the people who lived on Holcombe Moor (organised by the History sub
    committee) and our website costs and other promotional activities.</p>
