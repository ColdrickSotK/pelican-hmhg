Summary: Dover Chapel is a small building, located within the village of Greenmount. In June 2012, Greenmount Village held a special Jubilee party. HMHG undertook lots of activities including: a metal detector treasure hunt for the kids, other childrens games and competitions and a big display of who we were and what we do. As if that wasn't enough - we also did a Community Dig! The dig was a success. We attracted lots of interest from passers by, got some people who had never dug before to join in and even signed up some new members! On the 28th and 29th July 2012 we started a full scale dig.

During July to October 2012 the group undertook an excavation on a site known in the records as Dover Chapel, located in a residents back garden off Brandlesholme Road in Greenmount. The main aim of the project was to unearth more information about Dover Chapel and how it got its name. Various possibilities include:
- It was a private chapel
- It was an unrecorded meeting room for dissenters
- It was never a chapel but was simply called that as a mistake on an earlier map
- The name chapel came from a corruption of another name

The excavation began as a community dig as part of the Jubilee Celebrations held in Greenmount Village held in June 2012. A trench was dug which revealed a wall and plenty of small finds.

In July, HMHG returned to the site to carry out further investigations. The trench begun at the community dig was reopened and extended to uncover further walls, a flagstone pathway on the outside of the building and other internal features.

Other trenches were also opened around the garden, locating the four corners of the building, drains, evidence of waterproofing of the building to the east and an internal fireplace. We also managed to locate the original entrance to the site situated off Sedgewell Lane (now a public footpath). An unexpected discovery towards the end of the project was an early ditch under the South West corner and the western wall of the building. Could this be an early boundary ditch for Greenmount or maybe a drainage ditch as the site is a very wet site? Unfortunately, from the evidence we found, we were not able to reach a conclusion about the use of the building other than as a domestic dwelling.
