Short: Excavating an unknown building in Greenmount. Maybe a chapel, maybe not!
Summary: Dover Chapel is a small building, located within the village of Greenmount. In June 2012, Greenmount Village held a special Jubilee party. HMHG undertook lots of activities including: a metal detector treasure hunt for the kids, other childrens games and competitions and a big display of who we were and what we do. As if that wasn't enough - we also did a Community Dig! The dig was a success. We attracted lots of interest from passers by, got some people who had never dug before to join in and even signed up some new members! On the 28th and 29th July 2012 we started a full scale dig.
