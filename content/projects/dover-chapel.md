Short: Excavating an unknown building in Greenmount. Maybe a chapel, maybe not!
Summary: Dover Chapel is a small building, located within the village of Greenmount. In June 2012, Greenmount Village held a special Jubilee party. HMHG undertook lots of activities including: a metal detector treasure hunt for the kids, other childrens games and competitions and a big display of who we were and what we do. As if that wasn't enough - we also did a Community Dig! The dig was a success. We attracted lots of interest from passers by, got some people who had never dug before to join in and even signed up some new members! On the 28th and 29th July 2012 we started a full scale dig.

    During July to October 2012, the group undertook an excavation on a site
    known in the records as Dover Chapel, located in a residents back garden
    off Brandlesholme Road in Greenmount. The main aim of the project was to
    unearth more information about Dover Chapel and how it got it's name.
    Various possibilities include: it was a private chapel, an unrecorded
    meeting room for dissenters, it was never a chapel but was simply called
    that as a mistake on an earlier map, or the name chapel came from a
    corruption of another name.
  </p>

    The excavation began as a community dig as part of the Jubilee
    Celebrations held in Greenmount Village held in June 2012.
    A trench was dug which revealed a wall and plenty of small finds.

    In July, HMHG returned to the site to carry out further investigations.
    The trench begun at the community dig was reopened and extended to
    uncover further walls, a flagstone pathway on the outside of the
    building and other internal features.
  </p>
  <p>
    Other trenches were also opened around the garden, locating the four
    corners of the building, drains, evidence of waterproofing of the
    building to the east and an internal fireplace. We also managed to
    locate the original entrance to the site situated off Sedgewell Lane
    (now a public footpath). An unexpected discovery towards the end of the
    project was an early ditch under the South West corner and the western
    wall of the building. Could this be an early boundary ditch for Greenmount
    or maybe a drainage ditch as the site is a very wet site? Unfortunately,
    from the evidence we found, we were not able to reach a conclusion about
    the use of the building other than as a domestic dwelling.
