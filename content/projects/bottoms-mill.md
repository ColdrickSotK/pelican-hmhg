Short: An excavation of an 18th century mill in the heart of the Holcombe Valley.
Summary:
    The excavation at Bottoms Mill began in 2011. Cinder Hill Engine House was
    originally marked on a map as an engine house. We decided to investigate
    this. Upon further inspection we discovered that this location used to be
    a mill, and was later converted into cottages for the workers of a new
    engine house that was built further downstream from here. Bottoms Mill is
    located in the picturesque heart of the Holcombe Valley. This location is
    currently in its last year of being excavated

Bottoms Mill was an 18th century mill, set in the heart of the Holcombe Valley. This dig began in 2012, and is currently on going. If you would like to get involved, please contact us. See our contact page for more information. The dig is due to end in October this year.

Blah blah blah need more info.
