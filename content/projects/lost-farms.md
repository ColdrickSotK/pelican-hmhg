Summary: This project is our longest, and our main objective as a group. We are trying to discover information about the number of farms that once dotted the landscape of the Holcombe Valley. We have currently collected a lot of old photographs of these such farms. If you have any photographs of this, we urge you to please send them to us to help further our research. So far we have discovered information about 10 farms. We also have 4 images of farms that we cannot recognise. If you can help us identify these farms, please contact us.
