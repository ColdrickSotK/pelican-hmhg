Summary: This project is our longest, and our main objective as a group. We are trying to discover information about the number of farms that once dotted the landscape of the Holcombe Valley. We have currently collected a lot of old photographs of these such farms. If you have any photographs of this, we urge you to please send them to us to help further our research. So far we have discovered information about 10 farms. We also have 4 images of farms that we cannot recognise. If you can help us identify these farms, please contact us.

For hundreds of years Holcombe Valley was home to a myriad of farms, cottages and homes to the countless families that lived there â€“ and we believe are the roots of many local people who are living in the area today. Partly because there is no through route and also because the land is owned by the MoD, remains of many buildings can still be seen. As a group we are researching the area through archaeology and examination of historic documents to bring the valley to life.

The original documents are generally located in Archives at Preston, Bury or Bolton although somewhat surprisingly, about 90% of what we need is available online, or we have photographed, and therefore most research can be done at home. This allows people to be involved in the group without needing to be based locally.

Below is a list of cottages and farmsteads once on the moorland, just click on one of the names to explore!
